## Learning Objectives

-   Recognize potential sources of bias and conflicts of interest in risk assessment determinations
-   Identify key components of a successful risk communication message

## Framework for Risk-based Decision-making

![](images/risk_framework.png)

# Conflicts of Interest and Bias

## Conflict of Interest (COI) and Bias

-   COI: duty of loyalty or responsibility to two distinct parties, both of which are likely to be affected in different ways by the activity in which the individual is engaged

-   COI policies generally address financial conflicts

-   Policies for handling financial COI issues generally rely on disclosure as a mechanism to manage COI

## Bias and values in scientific research

-   **Preference bias**: occurs when a research result unduly reflects the researchers' preference for it over other possible results

    -   *Biased experimental design*: the design of the studies made them unlikely to detect any effects
    -   *Biased interpretation of outcomes*: outcomes can be declared irrelevant, they can be attributed to a speculative alternative cause, or they can be declared insufficient for the validation of a decisive conclusion

-   **Publication bias** (biased communication and dissemination of results): experiments or trials with significant outcomes are more likely to be published than those with null or weak results

## Preference bias example

Study found that 90% of government-funded experiments on low-dose exposure to bisphenol A reported significant effects, while not a single industry-funded experimental study did

Some industry studies used a strain of rat (the CD-SD strain) insensitive to estrogen

## Manufactured Uncertainty: Doubt is their Product Arguments

    -   Served as Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health

-   Book documents tobacco industry's tactics: spawned a multi-million dollar industry dismantling public health safeguards in areas far from tobacco

-   Industry executives hired unscrupulous scientists and lobbyists to dispute scientific evidence about health risks

-   Product defense consultants:

    -   Increasingly **skewed the scientific literature**

    -   **Manufactured and magnified scientific uncertainty**

    -   **Influenced policy decisions** to the advantage of polluters and the manufacturers of dangerous products

-   Goal: **keep the public confused** about hazards (e.g., climate change, second-hand smoke, asbestos, lead, plastics, many other toxic materials)

-   **Constructed barriers**: harder for lawmakers, government agencies, and courts to respond to future threats

# Risk Communication

## Risk Communication Overview

<https://www.epa.gov/risk/risk-communication>

## Risk Communication Overview

-   Process of informing people about potential hazards to their person, property, or community

-   Situations of **high stress**, **high concern** or **controversy**

## Composition of message

-   Put a particular risk in context
-   Compare with other risks
-   Advise about risk reduction behavior
-   Encourage a dialogue

## Types of communication environments

## Risk Communication Strategy: Seven Cardinal Rules

1.  **Accept and involve the public as a legitimate partner: early involvement**

2.  **Plan carefully and evaluate your efforts**

-   set clear objectives

-   be attentive to needs and interests

-   train staff in communication skills

-   rehearse and test message

-   assess efforts and lessons learned


3.  **Listen to public's specific concerns**

-   find out what people think or want

-   recognize their feelings


4.  **Be honest and open**


5.  **Coordinate and collaborate with other credible sources**

6.  **Meet the needs of the media**

-   open and accessible to reporters

-   establish relationships of trust


7.  **Speak clearly and with compassion**

-   communicate on a personal level

-   use vivid, concrete images or examples

-   make technical risk data come alive

-   acknowledge and respond with words and emotions that people express


Covello, V. and F. Allen, 1988


## Develop Risk Messages

![](images/message_map.png){fig-align="center"}

## Risk Comparisons

-   Use risk comparisons effectively and cautiously

-   Can be an effective strategy:

    -   provide context for a situation
    -   help individuals put site-related risks in perspective

-   Inappropriate comparison can have disastrous results for the credibility and efforts of the communicator

## Beneficial Risk Comparisons

#  Probabilistic Risk Assessment 

”An analytical methodology used to incorporate information regarding uncertainty and/or variability into analyses to provide insight regarding the degree of certainty of a risk estimate and how the risk estimate varies among different members of an exposed population…”
EPA, 2014
Risk Assessment Forum White Paper

#  Point Estimate of Exposure Dose 

+ Deterministic risk assessment express health risks as a single numerical estimate of risk
	+ Assuming reasonable maximum exposure
		+ Compounds unrealistically high estimates
		+ Difficult to know/communicate the level of conservatism
	+ Assuming average exposure
		+ May present unacceptable risks
	+ Mostly qualitative assessment of uncertainty and variability

The NRC uses Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) to estimate risk by computing real numbers to determine what can go wrong, how likely is it, and what are its consequences. Thus, PRA provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the design and operation of a nuclear power plant.

#  Monte Carlo Simulation 

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation
Mathematical technique used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event
P redicts a set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values versus a set of fixed input values
Yields a range of possible outcomes with the probability of each result occurring   sensitivity analysis

#  Monte Carlo Simulation Steps 

https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/monte-carlo-simulation
Set up the predictive model, identifying both the dependent variable to be predicted and the independent variables (also known as the input, risk or predictor variables) that will drive the prediction.

#  Monte Carlo Simulation Steps

Specify probability distributions of the independent variables. Use historical data and/or the analyst’s subjective judgment to define a range of likely values and assign probability weights for each.

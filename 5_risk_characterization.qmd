## Lesson Objectives

-   Calculate hazard quotient / hazard index and cancer risk given the daily intake and appropriate toxicological values (RfD or slope factor)
-   Interpret hazard index and cancer risk values
-   Describe the uncertainty associated with risk estimates
-   Discuss potential ethical dilemmas involved with risk assessment

## Risk Assessment Overview

## Risk Characterization

EPA's risk-characterization step has four elements:

-   generation of a quantitative estimate of risk
-   qualitative description of uncertainty
-   presentation of the risk estimate
-   communication of the results of risk analysis

*Science and Judgement in Risk Assessment*, 1994

## Principles of Conducting Risk Characterizations

**TCCR:**

::: incremental
-   **Transparent** with methods, assumptions, logic, rational, extrapolations, and uncertainty
-   **Clear**: understood by readers internal and external to the process
-   **Consistent** with the RA policies of the organization and program
-   **Reasonable**: based on sound judgment and current science
:::

## Quantitative Estimates of Risk

::: incremental
-   **Threshold**

    -   Traditionally noncarcinogens

    -   Ratio that compares the exposure dose to the RfD

-   **Non-threshold**

    -   Traditionally carcinogens

    -   Probability of the incremental risk of developing cancer over a lifetime of exposure
:::

## Risk Characterization: Threshold

::: incremental
$Hazard Quotient = [\frac{Daily Intake}{RfD}]$

$HQ=[\frac{0.07 [\frac{mg}{kg-day}]}{0.14[\frac{mg}{kg-day}]}] = 0.5$

-   HQ: the ratio of the environmental exposure to the RfD or RfC
    -   Values greater than unity indicate the potential for systemic toxicity leading to adverse effects

    -   Less than 1: Generally considered "safe"

## Example: Ethyl Benzene

## Example: Ethyl Benzene Exposure

![](images/dw_eqn.png){fig-align="center" width="442"}

$Intake= \frac{\frac{0.00375 mg}{L} * \frac{1L}{day} * 6 years * \frac{350 days}{year} } {15 kg * 6 years * \frac{365 days}{year}} = 2.4*10^{-4} \frac{mg}{kg-day}$

## Example: Ethyl Benzene Risk Characterization

$HQ=\frac{2.4*10^{-4} [\frac{mg}{kg-day}]}{1*10^{-1}[\frac{mg}{kg-day}]} = 0.0024$

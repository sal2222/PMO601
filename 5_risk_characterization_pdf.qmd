## Lesson Objectives

-   Calculate hazard quotient / hazard index and cancer risk given the daily intake and appropriate toxicological values (RfD or slope factor)
-   Interpret hazard index and cancer risk values
-   Describe the uncertainty associated with risk estimates
-   Discuss potential ethical dilemmas involved with risk assessment

## Risk Assessment Overview

## Risk Characterization

EPA's risk-characterization step has four elements:

::: incremental
-   Generation of a quantitative estimate of risk
-   Qualitative description of uncertainty
-   Presentation of the risk estimate
-   Communication of the results of risk analysis
:::

*Science and Judgement in Risk Assessment*, 1994

## Principles of Conducting Risk Characterizations

**TCCR:**

::: incremental
-   **Transparent** with methods, assumptions, logic, rational, extrapolations, and uncertainty
-   **Clear**: understood by readers internal and external to the process
-   **Consistent** with the RA policies of the organization and program
-   **Reasonable**: based on sound judgment and current science
:::

## Quantitative Estimates of Risk

::: incremental
-   **Threshold**

    -   Traditionally noncarcinogens

    -   Ratio that compares the exposure dose to the RfD

-   **Non-threshold**

    -   Traditionally carcinogens

    -   Probability of the incremental risk of developing cancer over a lifetime of exposure
:::

## Risk Characterization: Threshold

![](images/dr_curve_label.png){fig-align="center" width="498"}

## Risk Characterization: Threshold

::: incremental
$Hazard Quotient = [\frac{Daily Intake}{RfD}]$

$HQ=\frac{0.07 [\frac{mg}{kg-day}]}{0.14[\frac{mg}{kg-day}]} = 0.5$

-   HQ: the ratio of the environmental exposure to the RfD or RfC
    -   Values greater than unity indicate the potential for systemic toxicity leading to adverse effects

    -   Less than 1: Generally considered "safe"
:::

## Hazard Index

-   Sum of hazard quotients of chemicals to which a person is exposed that affect the same target organ or operate by the same mechanism of action
-   An HI less than unity is generally understood as being indicative of lack of appreciable risk, and a value over unity indicates some increased risk
-   The larger the HI, the greater the risk, but the index is not related to the likelihood of adverse effect except in qualitative terms

## Example: Ethyl Benzene

UF: Interspecies; Intraspecies; Less than Chronic

## Example: Ethyl Benzene Exposure

![](images/dw_eqn.png){fig-align="center" width="442"}

## Example: Ethyl Benzene Exposure

$Intake= \frac{\frac{0.00375 mg}{L} * \frac{1L}{day} * 6 years * \frac{350 days}{year} } {15 kg * 6 years * \frac{365 days}{year}} = 2.4*10^{-4} \frac{mg}{kg-day}$

## Example: Ethyl Benzene Risk Characterization Calculation

$HQ=\frac{2.4*10^{-4} [\frac{mg}{kg-day}]}{1*10^{-1}[\frac{mg}{kg-day}]} = 0.0024$

## Risk Characterization: Non-Threshold

![](images/csf.png){fig-align="center" width="498"}

## Risk Characterization: Non-Threshold

$𝑪𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒆𝒓 𝑹𝒊𝒔𝒌=𝑫𝒂𝒊𝒍𝒚 𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒂𝒌𝒆∗𝑺𝒍𝒐𝒑𝒆 𝑭𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓$

$Risk= 0.0016 \frac{mg}{kg-day} * 0.09\frac{kg-day}{mg} = 1.4*10^{-4}$

## Example: Arsenic Exposure

$Intake= \frac{\frac{0.00375 mg}{L} * \frac{1L}{day} * 6 years * \frac{350 days}{year} } {15 kg * 70 years * \frac{365 days}{year}} = 2*10^{-5} \frac{mg}{kg-day}$

## Example: Arsenic Risk Characterization

![](images/arsenic_csf.png) <https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/iris2/chemicalLanding.cfm?&substance_nmbr=278>

## Example: Arsenic Risk Characterization Calculation

$Risk= 2*10^{-5} \frac{mg}{kg-day} * 1.5\frac{kg-day}{mg} = 3*10^{-5}$

Carcinogenic risk from oral exposure (unitless)

## Cumulative HQ and Risk

-   For multiple chemicals, hazard quotients can be summed to estimate an overall hazard index

-   Because cancer risks are expressed as unitless probabilities, their summation across multiple chemicals and exposure routes is mathematically appropriate

-   The EPA cautions that summing risks across multiple exposure pathways should be carefully considered

## Uncertainty and Variability

> Risk estimates calculated using the "Red Book" paradigm of combining exposure and toxicity are conditional estimates based on many assumptions about exposure and toxicity

![](images/uncertainty_variability.png)

## Uncertainty in Risk Characterization Step

-   What do other assessors, decision-makers, and the public need to know about the primary conclusions and assumptions, and about the balance between confidence and uncertainty in the assessment?

-   What are the strengths and limitations of the assessment?

*Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment*

## Uncertainty in Risk Characterization Step: Decision-Making

-   Numerical estimates should never be separated from the descriptive information that is integral to the risk assessment

-   For decisionmakers, a complete characterization (key descriptive elements along with numerical estimates) should be retained in all discussions and papers relating to an assessment used in decision-making

-   Differences in assumptions and uncertainties, coupled with non-scientific considerations called for in various environmental statutes, can clearly lead to different risk management decisions in cases with ostensibly identical quantitative risks; i.e., the "number" alone does not determine the decisions

*Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment*

## Uncertainty in Risk Characterization Step: Alternative Approaches

-   Consideration of alternative approaches involves examining selected plausible options for addressing a given uncertainty

-   The strengths and weaknesses of each alternative approach and as appropriate, estimates of central tendency and variability (e.g., mean, percentiles, range, variance)

-   The description of the option chosen should include the rationale for the choice, the effect of option selected on the assessment, a comparison with other plausible options, and the potential impacts of new research.

## Case Study: Lead and Cadmium Could Be in Your Dark Chocolate

-   Consumer Reports found dangerous heavy metals in chocolate from Hershey's, Theo, Trader Joe's and other popular brands

-   Cocoa solids

-   Rich in flavanol antioxidants linked to improved blood vessel function, reduced inflammation, and lower cholesterol

-   Source of heavy metals, especially cadmium

<https://www.consumerreports.org/health/food-safety/lead-and-cadmium-in-dark-chocolate-a8480295550/>

## Case Study: Lead and Cadmium Could Be in Your Dark Chocolate

-   CR compared to California's maximum allowable dose level (MADL) for lead (0.5 $\mu g$) and cadmium (4.1 $\mu g$)

-   TJ's 85% Cacao

-   Lead: 127%

-   Cadmium: 229%

*Assume*: based on full single package (article does not specify) Net WT. 3.5 oz (100 g)

-   Cadmium Oral food RfD = ?

-   Scenario: Adult/you eating **1 chocolate bar per day** for **20 years**

-   What is the Hazard Quotient?

## Case Study Calculation

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: true

ADD <- function ( Cd_bar = 4.1 * 2.29 / 1000, EF = 350, ED = 20, BW = 80, AT = 365 * ED){
  
  I = ( Cd_bar * EF * ED ) / ( BW * AT )
  return (I)
}

# Cadmium per bar: percent exceedance of CA MADL; convert µg to mg

# For a systemic (non-carcinogenic) effect:

ADD ()
```

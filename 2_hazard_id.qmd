## Review: What is Risk Assessment?

> Human-health risk assessment entails the evaluation of scientific information on the hazardous properties of environmental agents and on the extent of human exposure to those agents. The product of the evaluation is a statement regarding the probability that populations so exposed will be harmed, and to what degree.

*Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment (1994, "Blue Book")*

## Lesson Outline

-   Risk Perception

-   Planning & Scoping / Problem Formulation

-   Hazard Identification

## Lesson Objectives

-   Recognize how **risk perception** affects a person's assessment of a risk
-   Describe the purpose of **planning & scoping** and **problem formulation**
-   Discuss key considerations in the planning and scoping process
-   Describe the role **stakeholders** play in the risk assessment process

## Risk Perception

> Risk perceptions are beliefs about potential harm or the possibility of a loss. It is a subjective judgment that people make about the characteristics and severity of a risk.

*Darker C. (2013) Risk Perception. In: Gellman M.D., Turner J.R. (eds) Encyclopedia of Behavioral Medicine. Springer, New York, NY*

## Risk Perception Dimensions

## Acceptable Levels of Risk

-   Delaney Clause:

    -   Zero tolerance guidance:

    > the Secretary of the Food and Drug Administration shall not approve for use in food any chemical additive found to induce cancer in man, or, after tests, found to induce cancer in animals

    -   "*De minimis*" exception: carcinogenic food additive present at a concentration of less than 1 part in 1,000,000 --\> risk considered negligible

    -   Applied to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in meat

-   Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA / Superfund): 10^-4^ to 10^-6^

-   OSHA: 10^-3^

## Planning and Scoping

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Relatively new to human health risk assessment
-   Establishes the goals and focus of the assessment
-   Scope includes:
    -   hazards
    -   exposures
    -   conditions of use
    -   potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations

![](images/scope.png)
:::

## Planning and Scoping Considerations

- What decision is informed by risk assessment, when is decision anticipated, what are the risk management options? 
- What legal/statutory requirements affect risk management options and level/type of analysis? 
- What other considerations (e.g., environmental justice, life stage, cumulative risk, sustainability) or countervailing risks may influence risk management options and analyses? • What assessments (e.g., risk, economic) are needed to address decision-making needs? 
- What expertise, resources and timelines are available to conduct the assessments(s)?

## Examples of EPA Planning and Scoping

- National Ambient Air Quality Standards: an Integrated Review Plan developed that describes all phases of the review, including the risk/exposure assessment
- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants residual risk review: encompasses a set of emissions source categories for which risk assessments are of generally similar scope and basic design, while differing in specific aspects of the sources and the chemicals emitted
- CERCLA / Superfund human health risk assessments

## Problem Formulation

-   Translation of the planning and scoping phase
-   Generates two products:
    -   Conceptual model
    -   Analysis plan

## Conceptual Model

-   Identifies:
    -   Known or potential sources of contamination (soil, groundwater, surface water, air)
    -   Release mechanisms and receptor routes
    -   All potential exposure pathways
    -   Media and receptors associated with each
-   Maps out a framework that demonstrates the theoretical links between the pollutant source or agent and exposure points
-   Provides a convenient format to present an overall understanding of the problem and organizes available information in a structure that facilitates identifying missing data or uncertainty
-   Has features of both a scientific hypothesis and a work plan

## Generalized Conceptual Model

![EPA, 2014](images/generalized_conceptual.png)

## Conceptual Site Model

![](images/csm.png)

## Analysis Plan

-   Intentions and technical aspect of the risk assessment
-   Determines how conceptional model hypotheses will be assessed
-   May determine the level of confidence needed
-   Uncertainty and variability analysis
-   Addresses assessments of the hazard, dose-response, exposure and characterization

## Hazard Identification

> The determination of whether a particular chemical is or is not causally linked to particular health effects

> Process of determining whether exposure to an agent can cause an increase in the incidence of a health condition

*Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process*, 1983 ("Red Book")

## Hazard Identification (Blue Book Definition)

> identification of the contaminates that are suspected to pose health hazards, quantification on the concentration which they are present in the environment, a description of specific forms of toxicity that can be caused by the contaminates of concern, and an evaluation of the conditions in which these forms of toxicity be be expressed in exposed humans

*Science and Judgment in Risk Assessment*, 1994 ("Blue Book")

## Hazard Identification Questions

-   Can an exposure increase the incidence of specific adverse health effects?
-   Is it likely to occur in humans?
-   What **evidence** is there to characterize the link between the agent and effects?

## Sources of Evidence

-   Epidemiologic
-   Toxicity Testing
    -   *In vitro*: Under glass (i.e. cells)
    -   *In vivo*: Whole animal
-   Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships

## Epidemiological Studies

-   May provide evidence linking chemical exposure and human adverse health effect
-   Statistical associations
-   Limitations
    -   Difficult to prove causation
    -   Mechanism of disease
    -   Latency periods
    -   Generalizable
    -   Confounding and bias
    -   Exposure characterization

## In-Vivo Testing (Animal models)

-   Toxicity testing by endpoint
    -   Acute (7-14 days)
    -   Sub chronic (2-4 months)
    -   Chronic (at least 12 months)
-   Limitations:
    -   High doses are used, which may not reflect true mechanism or exposure
    -   May not reflect human response
    -   Extrapolation from high to low dose
    -   Life span of animal
    -   Cost

![](images/mouse.png){fig-align="right" width="138"}

## In-Vitro Testing

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Bioassay (i.e., Ames test for Genotoxicity)
-   Low cost, fast
-   Chemical screening
-   Used for mechanism of toxicity
-   Limitations:
    -   Biological interactions
    -   Predictive value
    -   Toxicity pathway

![](images/ames.png)
:::

## Tox21 Program

-   Developed and validated *in-vitro* cell-based assays using quantitative high-throughput screening
-   More than 70 assays developed

## Weight of Evidence (Predictive Validity)

-   Used to characterize the hazardous properties, mode of action (MOA), and dose response relationships using scientific data
-   Approaches:
    -   *Metaphorical*: examination of scientific evidence without prescribed methods
    -   *Methodological*: e.g., systematic review, quality criteria, meta-analysis, causal criteria
    -   *Theoretical*: serves as a label for a conceptual framework

## Summary: Planning and scoping

> Systematic and transparent planning and scoping promotes efficient time and resource management; agreement on the assessment’s purpose; communication within the team and with stakeholders; stakeholder buy-in and realistic expectations; better-informed decisions with high-quality data based on established objectives and using sound methods; participation from multiple disciplines; and documentation of decisions made and the rationales.

EPA *Guidelines for Human Exposure Assessment*



## Summary: Problem formulation

> Problem formulation has three key components: (1) identification of the individual, lifestage(s), group(s) or population(s) of concern; (2) a conceptual model presenting the anticipated pathway of the agent from the source to receptor of concern; and (3) an analysis plan that charts the approach for conducting the assessment. 

EPA *Guidelines for Human Exposure Assessment*

## Hazard Identification

> Hazard Identification entails identification of the contaminants that are suspected to pose health hazards, quantification of the concentrations at which they are present in the environment, a description of the specific forms of toxicity (neurotoxicity, carcinogenicity, etc.) that can be caused by the contaminants of concern, and an evaluation of the conditions under which these forms of toxicity might be expressed in exposed humans.

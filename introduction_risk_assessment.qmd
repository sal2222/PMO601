## Course Description

> Risk assessment involves many disciplines and tools that are used to evaluate and quantify/qualify risks. Environmental risk assessments typically fall into one of two areas: (1) Human Health; and (2) Ecological.\
> Focusing on human health, we will cover the fundamentals of environmental health risk assessment in-depth. This course provides the tools for understanding the science and art of the risk assessment process to effectively manage and communicate risk.

## Course Lesson Objectives

1.  Identify and apply fundamental risk assessment concepts and principles.
2.  Describe the basic steps in the risk assessment process.
3.  Perform fundamental cancer and noncancer calculations used in human health risk assessments.
4.  Understand and determine sources of uncertainty and variability in risk assessments.
5.  Understand ethical dilemmas inherent to human health risk assessment.
6.  Analyze regulatory applications of risk assessment and decision making.

## Lesson Objectives

1.  Define basic risk assessment terms and definitions.

2.  Understand how risk assessment is used in different contexts.

3.  Understand the regulatory basis for human health risk assessments.

## Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a **scientific process**.

Factors:

-   *How much of a stressor is present in an environmental medium (e.g., soil, water, air) over what geographic area?*

-   *How much contact (exposure) a person or ecological receptor has with the contaminated environmental medium?*

-   *How does a hazard affect the health of humans (e.g., toxicity) or ecological receptors (e.g., fish killed by lack of oxygen)?*

## Risk assessment is a dominant public-policy tool

-   Informs risk managers and the public about different policy options for protecting public health and the environment

-   Instrumental in fulfilling the missions of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other federal and state agencies

    -   Evaluating public health concerns

    -   Informing regulatory and technological decisions

    -   Setting priorities for research and funding

    -   Developing approaches for cost-benefit analyses

*Science and Decisions*

## Risk Assessment Challenges

-   Subject to considerable scientific, political, and public scrutiny
-   The science is increasingly complex
    -   Multiple chemical exposures
    -   Multiple risks
    -   Susceptibility in populations
    -   Life-cycle analysis
    -   Costs, benefits, and risk trade-offs
-   Process is bogged down: major risk assessments for some chemicals take more than 10 years *(e.g., trichloroethylene,formaldehyde, dioxin)*
-   Tens of thousands of chemical in commerce

## Risk Assessment Development History

![](images/red_book.png) ![](images/blue_book.png) ![](images/silver_book.png)

## "Red Book" (1983)

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Defines risk assessment as: the use of the factual base to define the health effects of exposure of individuals and populations to hazardous materials and situations

-   Advocated for the separation of risk assessment from risk management

![](images/red_book.png)
:::

## "Blue Book" (1994)

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Addressed issues from Clean Air Act Amendments
-   Themes:
    -   Default values
    -   Validation of data and models
    -   Information and data needs
    -   Uncertainty
    -   Variability
    -   Aggregation of Risks

![](images/blue_book.png)
:::

## "Silver Book" (2009)

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
-   Recommendations to improve quality of the technical analysis and utility of risk assessments
-   Encouraged inclusion of quantitative estimates of uncertainty and variability at all key computational steps

## Statutes and Regulatory Structure

-   Statutes provide various standards and procedures related to the scientific analyses used to evaluate the risk potential of pollutants subject to the statutes

-   Provide agencies authority to regulate many forms of pollution

-   Enabling legislation for major EPA program offices:

    -   Air and radiation
    -   Water
    -   Solid waste
    -   Pesticides
    -   Toxic substances

-   Enacted prior to the emergence of risk analysis as an integrative discipline in the late 1970s and early 1980s

## Major U.S. environmental and occupational health laws

## Statutory Language Examples

## Clean Water Act

> “adequate to protect public health and the
environment from any reasonably anticipated adverse effects” (CWA § 405 (d)(2)(D))

## Clean Air Act
Addressing criteria pollutants:


> “reflecting the latest scientific knowledge”

> “national primary ambient air quality standards to . . . protect public health with
an adequate margin of safety” (CAA §§ 108,109)


## Toxic Substances Control Act
Primary purpose: 

> “to assure [that technologic]
innovation and commerce in such chemical substances and mixtures do not present
an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment” (TSCA § 2 (b)(3))


## Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
Criterion for registering a pesticide:

> “it will perform its intended function without
unreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment” (FIFRA § 3)


## 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments


> “The Administrator shall, in a document made
available to the public in support of a regulation promulgated under this section, specify, to
the extent practicable
– Each population addressed by any estimate of public health effects
– The expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations
– Each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk” (SDWA § 300g-1
(b)(3)).
